## Downstream by Shira Kammen

Adapted from [musescore.com/veatsfx/downstream].

for the soprano recorder and
the alto C ocarina. I only made a few adjustments:

1. Remove any slurs and bowing indications.
2. Transpose down:
  - By two semitones (from A major to G major) for the soprano recorder.
  - By four semitones (from A major to F major) for the alto C ocarina.
