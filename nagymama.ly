    In this experiment, I'm going to try and remember the melody of a lullaby
    from my childhood. Although I have found references to the text, I could
    not find the full lyrics, nor any sheet music or recording related to this
    song.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    In this initial version, I went ahead and simply wrote down the melody,
    without thinking too much about scale and notation. I can't remember what
    key the song was in, but I could remember the melody relative to any pitch
    â€” so I started at the middle C.

    Note that in the score above, I only used sharp signs to denote any
    accidentals. However, this is clearly not right, e.g. we have both C and
    C-sharp, which suggests that that our C-sharp is probably a B-flat instead.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    To get the notation right, we should really go ahead and figure out what
    key we are in. Let's have a look at all the notes that we have above:

    Let's move it up one register, to make it easier to read:

\relative {
  f'4 g gis ais | c cis dis f |
}

\markup \column {
  \wordwrap {
    This is clearly bad: our notes don't go op one by one with the sharps,
    instead they stay (e.g. G, G-sharp) and then jump (e.g. A-sharp, C). Let's
    write down the same notes, this time using only flats:

\relative {

}

\markup \column {
  \wordwrap {
    Much better! Now the notes go up nicely, one step at a time. This also
    means that we can get rid of the accidentals, by adding a key signature.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    The key signature that contains flats on A, B, D and E denotes either
    A-flat major, or any of its modes, like F minor. Given the "feel" of this
    song, I'm guessing this is indeed F minor, but we'll get to that later.

    Neat! Now we have something concrete to play with.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    Remember in the beginning, how I said I did not remember the key this song
    was in? Now we've written it down in F minor, but knowing that it is in
    Aeolian mode (that is to say, it is in a minor scale), we can transpose it
    to any other minor scale, by simply moving each note up or down by the same
    number of semitones.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    For simplicity, let's transform it to a minor scale that is more
    beginner-friendly on the piano. By that I mean, one that has no
    accidentals, or in other words, doesn't use the black keys.
  }
  \vspace #1
  \wordwrap {
    We know that the C major doesn't use any black keys. The relative minor of
    the C major is A minor. To move from F minor to A minor, we move up by four
    semitones, which is the difference between a natural F and a natural A.
